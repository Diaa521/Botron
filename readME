# Botron – Browser Automation Bot

Botron is a Python bot built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/) that automatically visits allowed websites, interacts with cookie/reject buttons, and simulates user behavior such as scrolling.  
It is designed as a lightweight automation tool to demonstrate browser scripting and interaction handling.

---

##  Features
- Visits a random website from a predefined **allowed list**.
- Detects and clicks **reject/decline buttons** (e.g. cookie consent).
- Scrolls down and back up to simulate human browsing.
- Handles errors gracefully and closes the browser after each session.
- Customizable lists of:
  - `AllowedWebsites.py` → websites the bot can visit.
  - `Buttons.py` → rejection/decline buttons the bot can press.
